## Kubernetes Add-ons

### Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)
Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) extend the Kubernetes API by defining custom resources. They are essential building blocks for most Kubernetes add-ons, allowing them to introduce new object types into your cluster.

**Why use CRDs?**
- Define custom objects with specific schemas
- Extend Kubernetes functionality without modifying core code
- Enable declarative management of application-specific resources
- Allow operators to automate complex application management

The Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) serves as the vendor-neutral home for many of these projects, fostering collaboration between the industry's top developers, end users, and vendors. CNCF hosts critical components of the global technology infrastructure, including Kubernetes, Prometheus, and many other cloud-native tools.

[CNCF Website](https://www.cncf.io/)
## Key Objectives of CNCF
The Cloud Native Computing Foundation has several key objectives:
- Foster and sustain open source, vendor-neutral projects
- Create high-quality patterns for cloud native software
- Promote cloud native technologies and practices
- Support collaborative development among contributors
- Make cloud native ubiquitous and accessible to all


**Example CRD:**
```yaml
apiVersion: apiextensions.k8s.io/v1
kind: CustomResourceDefinition
metadata:
    name: backends.myapp.example.com
spec:
    group: myapp.example.com
    names:
        kind: Backend
        plural: backends
        singular: backend
    scope: Namespaced
    versions:
        - name: v1
            served: true
            storage: true
            schema:
                openAPIV3Schema:
                    type: object
                    properties:
                        spec:
                            type: object
                            properties:
                                host:
                                    type: string
                                port:
                                    type: integer
```

## What are Kubernetes controllers?

Kubernetes controllers are control loops that track your resource clusters and alter them to match the desired state in a continuous cycle. For example, if you need to roast a chicken at 400 degrees Fahrenheit, the control loop in this case would monitor the oven temperature to keep it as close to your desired temperature as possible. If the temperature goes below or above 400, the control loop automatically adjusts the oven controls to fix it.

This is exactly how Kubernetes controllers work — they monitor the resources and conditions an admin has requested in a desired state and implement them automatically. Controllers ensure that the desired and actual states are in constant alignment.

## What are Kubernetes operators?

Kubernetes operators are a subcategory of controllers that use API extensions — or custom resources — to complete tasks. Operators are typically constructed as a set of independent controllers, each responsible for its own subset of tasks and resources pertaining to the managed application.

While an operator shares similar functions with a controller, it exclusively utilizes custom resources and focuses on one domain.

On the other hand, controllers work without custom resources or API extensions and don’t need to connect to a specific domain. Operators are well-suited to meet operational needs for a specific application or platform, but they do not accommodate generic resource cluster states as well as controllers.

### KEDA
KEDA (Kubernetes Event-driven Autoscaling) is a Kubernetes-based event-driven autoscaler that can scale applications based on the number of events needing to be processed. It supports various event sources, including message queues, databases, and more.

#### Load Testing Tools
To validate KEDA's autoscaling capabilities, you can use these popular load testing tools:

**hey** - [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/rakyll/hey):
```bash
# Install hey
go install github.com/rakyll/hey@latest

# Basic load test with 200 requests, 20 concurrent
hey -n 200 -c 20 http://your-service

# Load test with custom duration
hey -z 30s http://your-service
```

**siege** - [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/JoeDog/siege):
```bash
# Install siege
apt-get install siege

# Basic load test
siege -c 25 -t 30S http://your-service

# Detailed load test with report
siege -c 50 -t 1M -v http://your-service
```

These tools help demonstrate KEDA's ability to scale based on incoming load.
[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/kedacore/keda)

![KEDA Architecture](https://keda.sh/img/keda-arch.png)

**Installation:**
```sh
helm repo add kedacore https://kedacore.github.io/charts
helm install keda kedacore/keda
```

**Example ScaledObject:**
```yaml
apiVersion: keda.sh/v1alpha1
kind: ScaledObject
metadata:
    name: example-scaledobject
    namespace: default
spec:
    scaleTargetRef:
        apiVersion: apps/v1
        kind: Deployment
        name: example-deployment
    minReplicaCount: 1
    maxReplicaCount: 10
    triggers:
    - type: azure-queue
        metadata:
            queueName: my-queue
            connectionFromEnv: QUEUE_CONNECTION_STRING
```

### Kyverno
Kyverno is a policy engine designed for Kubernetes. It allows you to manage, validate, and mutate Kubernetes resources using policies written in YAML.
[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/kyverno/kyverno)

![Kyverno Architecture](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcnEgVtDJ15EG_PzAZ5agKSzfFcxiU8wi1KCaoFkeCk1W0-0zkSRU8nsZyCZiDI0ZAS2im579UT5m9MLPs7BUIpXAmwG585lFPSzyBGYDsY9iSdzj3Wj3swlqbswq9cFHeGZF55fluvpf1Cn4mOubCZDl2Q?key=IQaL61ZX0_O9f9P2CJV79g)

### How Kyverno Works

Kyverno operates as a Kubernetes admission controller, intercepting requests to the Kubernetes API server and applying policies to these requests. It can validate, mutate, and generate configurations based on the policies defined. Kyverno policies are written in YAML and can be used to enforce best practices, ensure compliance, and automate configuration management.

**Key Features:**
- **Validation:** Ensures that resources comply with specified policies before they are created or updated.
- **Mutation:** Modifies resource configurations to match desired state or add default values.
- **Generation:** Automatically creates or updates resources based on other resources.

**Example Use Cases:**
- Enforcing label standards on all resources.
- Ensuring security contexts are set on all pods.
- Automatically adding network policies to namespaces.

Kyverno simplifies Kubernetes policy management by using familiar YAML syntax and integrating seamlessly with Kubernetes native resources.

**Installation:**
```sh
kubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kyverno/kyverno/main/definitions/release/install.yaml
```

**Example Policy:**
```yaml
apiVersion: kyverno.io/v1
kind: ClusterPolicy
metadata:
  name: forbid-cpu-limits
  annotations:
    policies.kyverno.io/title: Forbid CPU Limits
    policies.kyverno.io/category: Other
    policies.kyverno.io/subject: Pod
    kyverno.io/kyverno-version: 1.10.0
    kyverno.io/kubernetes-version: "1.26"
    policies.kyverno.io/description: >-
      Setting of CPU limits is a debatable poor practice as it can result, when defined, in potentially starving
      applications of much-needed CPU cycles even when they are available. Ensuring that CPU limits are not
      set may ensure apps run more effectively. This policy forbids any container in a Pod from defining CPU limits.      
spec:
  background: true
  validationFailureAction: Enforce
  rules:
  - name: check-cpu-limits
    match:
      any:
      - resources:
          kinds:
          - Pod
    validate:
      message: Containers may not define CPU limits.
      pattern:
        spec:
          containers:
          - (name): "*"
            =(resources):
              =(limits):
                X(cpu): null
```

```yaml
apiVersion: kyverno.io/v1
kind: ClusterPolicy
metadata:
  name: disallow-latest-tag
  annotations:
    policies.kyverno.io/title: Disallow Latest Tag
    policies.kyverno.io/category: Best Practices
    policies.kyverno.io/minversion: 1.6.0
    policies.kyverno.io/severity: medium
    policies.kyverno.io/subject: Pod
    policies.kyverno.io/description: >-
      The ':latest' tag is mutable and can lead to unexpected errors if the
      image changes. A best practice is to use an immutable tag that maps to
      a specific version of an application Pod. This policy validates that the image
      specifies a tag and that it is not called `latest`.      
spec:
  validationFailureAction: enforce
  background: true
  rules:
  - name: require-image-tag
    match:
      any:
      - resources:
          kinds:
          - Pod
    validate:
      message: "An image tag is required."
      pattern:
        spec:
          containers:
          - image: "*:*"
  - name: validate-image-tag
    match:
      any:
      - resources:
          kinds:
          - Pod
    validate:
      message: "Using a mutable image tag e.g. 'latest' is not allowed."
      pattern:
        spec:
          containers:
          - image: "!*:latest"
```

### Kyverno and Grafana Integration

Kyverno can be integrated with Grafana to provide visual monitoring and analytics of policy enforcement. This integration allows administrators to track policy violations, audit events, and overall compliance status through customizable dashboards.

**Key Features:**
- Real-time policy violation monitoring
- Historical compliance trends
- Resource admission statistics
- Policy enforcement metrics
- Automated alerts for violations

To set up monitoring:
1. Configure Prometheus metrics in Kyverno
2. Import Kyverno dashboards in Grafana
3. Set up alerting rules for policy violations

Sample metrics available:
- `kyverno_policy_results_total`
- `kyverno_policy_execution_duration_seconds`
- `kyverno_policy_changes_total`

    scale-down-unneeded-time: 10m
```

### Karpenter
Karpenter is an open-source node provisioning project built for Kubernetes.

### Features Overview
The AKS Karpenter Provider enables node autoprovisioning using Karpenter on your AKS cluster. Karpenter improves the efficiency and cost of running workloads on Kubernetes clusters by:

- Watching for pods that the Kubernetes scheduler has marked as unschedulable
- Evaluating scheduling constraints (resource requests, node selectors, affinities, tolerations, and topology-spread constraints) requested by the pods
- Provisioning nodes that meet the requirements of the pods
- Removing the nodes when they are no longer needed
- Consolidating existing nodes onto cheaper nodes with higher utilization per node

### Node Auto Provisioning (NAP) vs. Self-hosted
Karpenter provider for AKS can be used in two modes:

- **Node Auto Provisioning (NAP) mode (preview):** Karpenter is run by AKS as a managed addon similar to managed Cluster Autoscaler. This is the recommended mode for most users. Follow the instructions in Node Auto Provisioning documentation to use Karpenter in that mode.
- **Self-hosted mode:** Karpenter is run as a standalone deployment in the cluster. This mode is useful for advanced users who want to customize or experiment with Karpenter's deployment. The rest of this page describes how to use Karpenter in self-hosted mode.

### Known limitations
- Only AKS clusters with Azure CNI Overlay + Cilium networking are supported.
- Only Linux nodes are supported.
